# Diabetes_predict

#This project analyze a diabetes dataframe. This dataframe contains medical informations, and these data are used to predict the chances of being with diabetes.
# In this project,it is used Python language, with some libraries. They are: sklearn,  seaborn and pandas.

#Pandas: a libray in which it's possible to manipulate and analyse data, in tabular form. Some examples are spreadsheets, datasets and dataframes, which can be created. Furthermore, it's also possible to extract statistical informations.

#Sklearn: contains machine learning algoritms, used in predictions and analysis. It also has datasets, which can be used to study informations about how data science works, and study AI concepts. This project used diabetes dataset.

#Seaborn: is a library which provides the creation and manipulation of statistical graphics. It's possible to define data, and another informations to create graphics, for instance, the size and format.

#This project used Linear Regression algorithm. It is from supervised learning, and predicts the value of a variable, based on the value of another variable.
#The variable which is goint to be predicted is dependent variable, and the variable used to make predictions is independent variable.
#It estimates the coefficients of a linear equation, involving one or more independent variable, that best predict the dependent variable.
#Linear Regression has X(dependent variable) and y(independent variable), and it fits a straight line on the surface, to minimize discrepancies between predicted values and output results. There's also a method called "least squares" that gets an amount of data, and it tries to find out the best-fit line for it. Thus, it is possible to estimate X from y.
